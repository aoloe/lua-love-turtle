# Turtle with Löve

A Lua module for [Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) using [Löve](https://love2d.org/)

The API is inspired by the [Turtle library for Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html).  
Only a subset of the commands are implemented.

## Usage

For now, have a look at the `main.lua` file for a first sample usage.
